## CSC 205 Final Project
### Spring 2017

This game was built by the following group members:
- Sydney Koncz
- Jonathan Grandfield
- Daniel Frankcom

As the final project for our "Introduction to Game Development" course, we constructed this combination between the classic arcade game "TRON", and the currently popular vehicular soccer game "Rocket League".

The game is built in Unity, and employs many of the skills and techniques that we learned in the class throughout the term.
